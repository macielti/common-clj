# common-clj

Just common Clojure codes that I use across projects.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your project or build file:

`[net.clojars.macielti/common-clj "x.y.z"]`

You can check for the last available version on [Clojars page](https://clojars.org/net.clojars.macielti/common-clj/).

## Documentation

Tests are the best documentation! Better than nothing.

That's all what I have for now. I am planning to add proper documentation in a near future.
